Or you can simply use one of the 3 inbuilt templates. Read more about how to customize the templates in [this guide](https://slicedinvoices.com/support/quote-invoice-templates/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Readme-FAQ&utm_content=Support&utm_campaign=Free)

The [PDF & Email Extension](https://slicedinvoices.com/extensions/pdf-email/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Readme-FAQ&utm_content=PDF-Email&utm_campaign=Free) will add a 'Print PDF' button to the admin area and also to the top of the invoice, allowing your client to easily print the invoice to PDF.

### Are recurring and part payment invoices supported?

Invoices could be renamed to Tax Invoice, Bill, Sale, Account, Statement or whatever else you desire.
Quotes could be renamed to Estimate, Proposal, Tender, Bid or anything else.

## Changelog
##  3.9.4
* FIX: calculations on quote/invoice editing page not updating when a line item is removed.

##  3.9.3
* FIX: restrict access to sending emails to Adminstrator users only (thanks to Patchstack).  NOTE: Patchstack reported a vulnerability where existing users of any role could abuse an AJAX URL to send emails through Sliced Invoices.  To exploit this, the attacker would have to already have access to an existing user account and be logged in to do so -- no access was open to the general public.  Please note this is a theoretical vulnerability only -- we have no reports of any such attacks actually taking place in the real world.

##  3.9.2
* UPDATE: add filter `sliced_invoices_check_for_reminder_args`.
* UPDATE: German translation update (thanks to Christian Högl).
* UPDATE: minor CSS/styling updates (thanks to Dax Liniere).
* FIX: PHP 8.1/8.2 notices.

* UPDATE: Spanish translation update (thanks to Lolo Marchal).
* FIX: pre-defined line items not populating description field since 3.9.0.

##  3.9.0
* NEW: add "Create new Invoice from Quote" button on quote editing page; renamed existing "Convert to Invoice" button "Convert Quote to Invoice" for extra clarity.
* NEW: add fields for both live and sandbox PayPal API keys (now you can store them together and easily switch with the "Gateway Mode" setting).
* NEW: add global functions `sliced_invoices_create_invoice` and `sliced_invoices_create_quote` for creating invoices/quotes programmatically.
* NEW: add option "Decline Reason Required" under Quote Settings.
* NEW: autofill username when adding new client using "Add New Client" modal.
* NEW: automatically mark invoices as "Paid" when entering manual payments, if there is zero balance remaining.
* NEW: improved "Discount" field now has options for fixed amount vs percentage, and before tax vs after tax.
* UPDATE: add compatibility with PHP 8.0. (IMPORTANT - if you are planning to try PHP 8, please be sure to update ALL your Sliced Invoices plugins/extensions to the latest versions BEFORE you update PHP).
* UPDATE: add extra checks to prevent quotes from being accepted or declined more than once.
* UPDATE: add new filters `sliced_get_email_headers`, and `sliced_invoices_non_cloneable_post_metas`.
* UPDATE: add new hooks `sliced_invoices_admin_before_create_invoice_from_quote`, `sliced_invoices_admin_after_create_invoice_from_quote`, `sliced_invoices_admin_before_convert_quote_to_invoice`, and `sliced_invoices_client_before_accept_quote`.
* UPDATE: add parameter `$new_post_id` to hook `sliced_client_accepted_quote`.
* UPDATE: remove deprecated filters `sliced_admin_display_totals_after_tax`, and `sliced_get_line_item_totals`.
* UPDATE: remove filter `sliced_totals_discounts` (not used), replace with new filters `sliced_totals_discounts_before_tax` and `sliced_totals_after_tax`.

* FIX: issue with populating pre-defined line items after deleting previous line items.
* FIX: issue with Quick Edit removing HTML formatting from Terms and Conditions field.
* FIX: various minor translation issues; removed the word "Bummer". :(

##  3.8.17
* FIX: commas incorrectly removed from "To" field in email preview window, whenever multiple email addresses filtered in.
* FIX: second-order SQL injection vulnerability if an existing meta_key contains unsafe code (thanks to Wordfence).  NOTE: to exploit this, an attacker would need to first be logged in as an administator, and be able to insert a specially-crafted post meta containing malicious code.
